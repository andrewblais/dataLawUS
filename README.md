# dataLawUS

A Python Jupyter Notebook project whose structure was created by Angela Yu and which I completed for Professional Portfolio Project: Assignment 19: [Angela Yu 100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) -- "Data Science: Analyse Deaths involving Police in the United States".

This is the FINAL project in Angela Yu's 100 Day's course.

Project structure:

The main part of this project is found in the project directory's `/main.ipynb` file.

The primary data file source, `/mission_launches.csv`, which is based on Angela's original file, has been updated by my scraping script with Selenium.

A blank template of the project, from Angela Yu's course is also in the project directory: `/main_original_project_start.ipynb`. This file can be used to compare which questions/code/notes are hers and which parts of the project are my code.

The project directory's sub-folder `/scrapeStuff` contains the code I wrote to scrape the web and update the .csv data files, which are used in the `.ipynb` script to create the DataFrame. It also contains all the secondary/old data files.

The `/plots` folder contains .PNGs of all the plots from `/main.ipynb`.

The `/pdf` folder contains a .pdf and .html copy of the `/main.ipynb` file.

`/static` contains an image file used in Angela's template.

## Created in completing the FINAL ASSIGNMENT for Angela Yu Course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.

### **Day 100, Professional Portfolio Project [Data Science]**

#### **_Assignment 19: "Analyse Deaths involving Police in the United States"_**

Extract insights from combining US census data and the Washington Post's database on deaths by police in the United States.

### **Assignment instructions:**

Today you will do some deep analysis around an incredibly sensitive and politically charged topic. Since Jan. 1, 2015, [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty. You will analyse this dataset together with US census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics. This way we better understand social trends and what is going on with the fatal use of force by the police in the United States.
